# ssv-api (Starter Single Verticle API)

Template REST API project ready to deploy. REST API based in vert.x framework with lots of plumbing code, examples, use cases and documentation to quickly develope an API with almost no knowledge of vert.x and without any waste of time. It is intended to: 
- Developers who want to quickly and efficiently develop an API without microservices architecture (for now) concentrating only on the business.
- Developers and students who want to learn to work with the vert.x framework.
- Developers who need to develop an API with vert.x and have little or no knowledge of vert.x

## Testing ⚙️

In the directory of the project there is a "postmanTests" folder that has a Postman collection that has a battery of tests for the API endpoints. With this project, from Postman, code examples can be self-generated to consume the different services for different languages and technologies.

It also has a battery of unit tests that are run every time the project is compiled. This behavior can be disabled by setting the _**skipTests**_ property of the _**pom.xml**_ to _**true**_. It is highly recommended to leave it in _**false**_ since if any change in the code adds an error to the system, it will be detected quickly.
